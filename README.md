## UFCFY3-15-3 Bio-Computing Assignment

It's really simple. 

You get:
* 3 data files
* Be told to make an algorithm to put inputs and get output.
* And get no help at all.

And then you're supposed to write a 1000 word essay on your findings
from the assignment. 

### How to run the programs. 
For the binary datasets, you will need to change a few things to switch betwen dataset 1 and 2. 
- Population gene size
- input file
- output file

To run the binary dataset, cd into the binary folder and do `python binary.py`

The floating point dataset can be run immediately by cding into the directory and 
running `python float.py`
