Couple things I have seen from looking at the link you have sent. 
I have tinkered around and printed values here and there to make sense of it. 

- The algorithm creates its own random population at startup and sends that through the algorithm.
- It is using binary strings (11001). Things like that so it is quite similar already to my assignment. 
- There is an objective function, which I do not understand much. 
- As far as selection, crossover and mutation goes, it is run on a given gene and it does make sense. 

The binary GA tries to get everyoneâ€™s genes to be 1 (11111) and the float value thing tries to reach 0.

I have also gone through the code that uses float values and the difference I have found there is that while it does generate random values on its own just like the binary one, this one has a decode function where it takes the bitstring and converts it to a float. 

Now I guess the main question is, how do I use the data I already have, and get the output it expects? Like what is the GA way to go on about it?

Also need to know what the objective function in this code actually means..
